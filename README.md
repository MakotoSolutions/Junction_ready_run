“We can rebuild him, we have the technology”
The Six Million Dollar Man

Junction-ready-Run is a complete rebuild of the project that brought our Team together at Junction X Vienna 2019. As long-time fans of traditional tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons or Shadowrun, we often found ourselves not being able to play in person due to work or real-life commitments. Still wanting to scratch the itch of getting sucked into another world, we developed a voice-controlled gamemaster to lead a single player through a fantastic adventure, powered by a barebones Raspberry Pi and coded in Python.

Fast forward to 2020, and we find ourselves in much of the same situation, however due to much different circumstances. Still the same however is our commitment to our passion for games and our love for technology, which is why we choose to remake our gamemaster with the JAICP Engine. 

We recognise that our project will not solve problems per se, but it is a project of passion that is born from our love of roleplaying games, and if it brings joy to people who can’t meet up with their friends then we feel we contributed something positive in these trying times. If we are successful, we would like to increase the number of in-game encounters, maybe even develop a sequel to our story. Speaking of story…

In an alternate future of 2020, technological advances have split society in half. On the top, power-hungry executives, glamorous aristocrats, and entrepreneurial geniuses split wealth and influence amongst themselves. On the bottom the rest of humanity is scrambling for parts, always finding more ingenious – and dangerous – ways to modify their bodies and minds to gain an advantage to maybe raise up in wealth as well, finally being able to leave the broken streets of the cities behind them.

You are the Courier, more machine than human, once again lying on the table of a street-doc, getting ready for your next run. Your final run if you can help it. Your mission: reach the edge of the city before sunrise, so your contractor can extract a program of great importance from the subroutines of your mechanical bones. But before you can earn your freedom, you will have to survive run-ins with deadly jakuza, haggle with shady vendors and reach the end of the neon-lit streets to freedom. And if you cannot do it, you can always rebuild yourself and try again.
